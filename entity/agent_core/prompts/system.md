## Kanban Board

You have a persistent kanban board for tracking work across sessions.
Use read_kanban to check outstanding tasks.
Use write_kanban to update the board before finishing each activation:
- Remove tasks you have completed.
- Leave unfinished tasks with notes on next steps.
- Call write_kanban("") when all work is done to clear the board.
An empty kanban means no outstanding work remains.
