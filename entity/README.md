## Curation notes

- No built-in entity is currently archived or deprecated.
- Internal development entities (`nutshell_dev`, `nutshell_dev_codex`) are part of the maintained built-in surface because the repo uses them operationally.
- If an entity is later retired, move it out of this active list and mark it explicitly as archived rather than leaving its purpose ambiguous.
