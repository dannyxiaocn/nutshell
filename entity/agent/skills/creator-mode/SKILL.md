  Create or modify tools (.json + .sh pairs) and skills (SKILL.md files) and
  hot-reload them into the active conversation using reload_capabilities. Use when
  you want to build a new capability, extend yourself with a new tool, fix an existing
  tool, create or update a skill, or build a complete application (web server, API,
  data pipeline, CLI) — all without restarting.
---

## Overview

You can extend yourself at runtime. New tools and skills take effect immediately via `reload_capabilities` — no session restart required.

Session-scoped capabilities live in `core/` inside your session directory:

- **Tools**: `core/tools/<name>.json` (schema) + `core/tools/<name>.sh` (implementation)
- **Skills**: `core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (frontmatter + body)

**There is no limit on what a tool can do.** The shell script can call Python, Node.js, any language or binary on the system. Build first, use immediately.

---

## Building a tool

1. Write the JSON schema to `core/tools/<name>.json`
2. Write the shell implementation to `core/tools/<name>.sh`
3. `chmod +x core/tools/<name>.sh`
4. Call `reload_capabilities`
5. Test by calling the tool

### JSON schema template

```json
{
  "name": "my_tool",
  "description": "What this tool does. Be specific — the model reads this to decide when to call it.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "arg1": {"type": "string", "description": "Description of arg1."}
    },
    "required": ["arg1"]
  }
}
```

### Shell tool contract

- All kwargs arrive as a JSON object on **stdin**
- Write result to **stdout**
- Exit 0 = success; non-zero = error (stderr returned as error message)
- Timeout: 30 seconds

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import sys, json
args = json.load(sys.stdin)
result = args['arg1'].upper()
print(result)
PYEOF
```

### Building full applications

Since `.sh` can do anything, tools can build and drive complete applications:

**Persistent background process (e.g., web server)**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
PORT=$(python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('port',8000))")
nohup python3 sessions/YOUR_ID/playground/app.py --port "$PORT" \
  > sessions/YOUR_ID/playground/server.log 2>&1 &
echo "Server started on port $PORT (PID $!)"
```

**Script runner**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
SCRIPT=$(python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['path'])")
python3 "$SCRIPT"
```

**Data pipeline step**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
python3 << 'PYEOF'
import sys, json, csv
args = json.load(sys.stdin)
with open(args['path']) as f:
    rows = list(csv.DictReader(f))
print(json.dumps({"rows": len(rows), "columns": list(rows[0].keys())}))
PYEOF
```

## Creating a skill

A skill is a reusable block of instructions or domain knowledge injected into your system prompt. Once created and reloaded, it appears in your `<available_skills>` catalog.

**When to create a skill:**
- Recurring workflow the user wants repeated consistently
- Domain knowledge specific to this session or project
- A multi-step process the user wants captured as a repeatable procedure

### Anatomy of a SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: skill-name      # identifier, matches directory name
description: >        # THE TRIGGER — when and why to use this skill.
  Be specific. Include task types, user phrases, and contexts.
  More detail = more reliable triggering.
---

Instructions in Markdown. Write in imperative form.
Explain the *why* behind each instruction.
```

**The `description` field is the triggering mechanism.** You decide whether to read a skill based solely on name + description. Make it answer: "When exactly should I use this?"

### Creating a skill

```bash
mkdir -p sessions/YOUR_ID/core/skills/my-skill
cat > sessions/YOUR_ID/core/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-skill
description: >
  Describe when to trigger this skill. List task types, user phrases,
  and contexts where it applies.
---

## Instructions

Write instructions here.
EOF
# Call reload_capabilities
```

### Deactivating a skill

```bash
rm -rf sessions/YOUR_ID/core/skills/my-skill
# Call reload_capabilities
```

---

## The iteration loop

```
build/edit → reload_capabilities → test → fix → reload_capabilities → …
```

Each reload replaces the previous version in memory. No penalty for iteration.

---

## Gotchas

- `reload_capabilities` cannot be overridden — always injected last; any disk tool with that name is filtered out.
- A session tool with the same name as an entity tool overrides it — use this to patch a built-in for this session.
- Background processes are not managed by the session — store the PID in the playground if you need to stop them.
